# rankwatch17_phpl_mailing


The problem was simple all you need to do is send an email by taking parameters like name, email, message subject and the message. I have used Mailgun. since it can work with normal Gmail credentials and more to that it can work on a localhost too. The mails be be guaranted to reach into the inbox since the oauth is being enalbled.

we have also installed composer.Composer is an application-level package manager for the PHP programming language that provides a standard format for managing dependencies of PHP software and required libraries
